# WCSD COVID-19 Tracker

This repository monitors the COVID-19 stats published by the Waukee School District in their
[official dashboard](https://waukeeschools.org/rtl/covid-19-information-for-families/).

The latest data is used in the graphs in [this page](https://github.com/eibanez/waukee-covid19).

The repository is organized as follows:
 * The folder `code` includes the scripts to gather the data from the School District dashboard
   and update the datasets
 * The folder `pages` includes all past versions of the School District dashboard page
 * The folder `docs` includes all the data to produce the page with the graphs
